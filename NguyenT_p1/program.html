                  Yale College students interested in pursuing the art major or
                  taking elective courses in the School of Art should follow
                  these steps:
                </p>
                <h4>1.Explore the Curriculum:</h4>
                <li>
                  Review the course offerings and major requirements on the Yale
                  School of Art and Yale College websites.
                </li>
                <h4>2.Advising and Consultation:</h4>
                <li>
                  Schedule a meeting with an academic advisor or faculty member
                  in the art department to discuss your interests and academic
                  goals.
                </li>
                <h4>3.Declare the Major:</h4>
                <li>
                  If you decide to major in art, formally declare your major
                  through the Yale College registrar's office and complete any
                  necessary paperwork.
                </li>
                <h4>4.Submit a Portfolio:</h4>
                <li>
                  While not always required for elective courses, students
                  declaring an art major or applying for advanced studio courses
                  may need to submit a portfolio of their work. Check specific
                  course requirements for details.
                </li>
                <h4>5.Enrollment:</h4>

                  Register for the desired courses through Yale's online course
                  registration system during the designated enrollment period.
                </li>
                <h4>6.Prepare for Class:</h4>
